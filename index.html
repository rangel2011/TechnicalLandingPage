                        <p> One of the first things that you should do before considering coding is taking a free class from Harvard. This course is called CS50 and it serves as a great foundational knowledge source. The course provides the "whys" for why programming languages work and how they work together too. It is also completely free, so why not take a free course and expand your own knowledge too? </p>
                        <p> Here is the link that can take you to the course information. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a></p>
                        <p> Some of the things that you will learn during the course are 
                            <ul>
                                <li> A broad and robust understanding of computer science</li>
                                <li> how to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently</li>
                                <li> Familiarity in a number of languages, including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML</li>
                                <li>How to engage with a vibrant community of like-minded learners from all levels of experience</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>After taking some time in the course, or if you may have skipped it all together, you can continue on with the websites down below. I have included free resources to use. You are more than welcome to donate to them, or even pay for the pro version for one of them. I can not speak to anything else besides the free ones, because broke teacher over here.</p>

                        <p>I personally started with FreeCodeCamp when I got into coding. Like others who started with FreeCodeCamp, I began with the Responsive Web Design Certification. During this course, I began to learn about HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I actually made this documentation page as one of their certification projects for that course.</p>
                        <p> Using just FreeCodeCamp though made me realize that I had gaps in my education that I wanted to get filled. That lead me to looking into the other two resources below. </p>
                        <p> FreeCodeCamp offers such a great curriculum though! That is coming from a teacher and understanding the learning process. The curriculum is laid out nicely along with the hands on practice that is needed with coding.</p>
                        <p>Their courses include
                            <ul>
                                <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
                                <li>JavaScript Algorithmis and Data Structures</li>
                                <li> Front End Development Libraries</li>
                                <li> Data Visualization</li>
                                <li> Back End Development and APIs </li>
                                <li> Quality Assurance </li>
                                <li>Scientific Computing with Python</li>
                                <li> Information Secuity </li>
                                <li> Machine Learning with Python</li>
                                <li> Coding Interview Prep</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>

                        <p>The next resource that I found is Code Academy. I ended up doing some of the courses within the Learn HTML, Learn JavaScript, and Learn SQL courses.</p>
                        <p>Within the Learn HTML course, I had the opportujity to practice what I had learned in the courses from FreeCodeCamp. It was nice though to see that the skills that I had devloped in HTML were transferable and I felt started to understand a little bit more of the language.</p>
                        <p>The next course that I started was the Learn JavaScript course. I did have some experiece with JavaScript because I was taking courses in Galvanize's Engineering Bootcamp Prep. Once again, it was nice ot see the knowledge that I had gained was transferable into what this course was asking for.</p>
                        <p>Last was the Learn SQL course that I took. I have to be honest, this was something that I just started but did not really get into it. Looking at data and tables like that just was not for me.</p>
                        <p> Code Academy offers many courses that include 
                            <ul>
                                <li>Learn how to code</li>
                                <li>Python</li>
                                <li>Front-End Engineer</li>
                                <li>Web Development</li>
                                <li>Data Science</li>
                                <li>Full-Stack Engineer</li>
                                <li>Video Resources</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>Code Academy also offers a pro version of their curriculum. I have not used the pro version, but from what I have understood, the pro version offers more projects for you to build as you progress through the curriculum.</p>
                        <p> You can begin their courses here. <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn">CodeAcademy</a></p>

                        <p>The last free resource that I came upon was called The Odin Project. I have to be honest, I am happy that I came upon this one last and already had some background knoweldge from the previous two resources. </p>
                        <p>The Odin Project pretty much throws you right into the curriculum. I have to say that one of my favorite things though is the use of vidoes throughout the lessons. The lessons are webpages that also send you to outside videos to gain a better understanding of the material that is being presented.</p>
                        <p>Once you complete the Foundations course, you are given the options to take two paths. Full Stack Ruby on Rails or Full Stack JavaScript</p>
                        <p>The two paths are the same in that in the end you will know how to create beautiful responsive websites from scratch. The only difference is the Ruby on Rails teaches you Ruby, while Full Stack JavaScript teaches you JavaScript and NodeJs.</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>The last thing that I would say that you will need to do to get better at coding is personal projects. I entered an Introduction Bootcamp courses and ended up hating it. The reason was because of the projects that I needed to make. They were projects that I just had no passion for making.</p>
                        <p>By working on the different free resources, you are exposed to many different things you can make. These personal projects, coming from a teacher perspective, is what fuels creativity and learning.</p>
                        <p>Coding is something that you have to do daily to get better at it. I can even tell you that in the few months that I have practiced, my code is so much neater, but also more complicated for what I can do. There is so much more to learn though and that is what makes coding and learning beautiful. There is always something new to learn, if you are willing to do a little bit better each day.</p>
