                        <p> One of the first things that you should do before considering coding is taking a free class from Harvard. This course is called CS50 and it serves as a great foundational knowledge source. The course provides the "whys" for why programming languages work and how they work together too. It is also completely free, so why not take a free course and expand your own knowledge too? </p>
                        <p> Here is the link that can take you to the course information. <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">CS50's Introduction to Computer Science</a></p>
                        <p> Some of the things that you will learn during the course are 
                            <ul>
                                <li> A broad and robust understanding of computer science</li>
                                <li> how to think algorithmically and solve programming problems efficiently</li>
                                <li> Familiarity in a number of languages, including C, Python, SQL, and JavaScript plus CSS and HTML</li>
                                <li>How to engage with a vibrant community of like-minded learners from all levels of experience</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
                        <p>After taking some time in the course, or if you may have skipped it all together, you can continue on with the websites down below. I have included free resources to use. You are more than welcome to donate to them, or even pay for the pro version for one of them. I can not speak to anything else besides the free ones, because broke teacher over here.</p>

                        <p>I personally started with FreeCodeCamp when I got into coding. Like others who started with FreeCodeCamp, I began with the Responsive Web Design Certification. During this course, I began to learn about HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript. I actually made this documentation page as one of their certification projects for that course.</p>
                        <p> Using just FreeCodeCamp though made me realize that I had gaps in my education that I wanted to get filled. That lead me to looking into the other two resources below. </p>
                        <p> FreeCodeCamp offers such a great curriculum though! That is coming from a teacher and understanding the learning process. The curriculum is laid out nicely along with the hands on practice that is needed with coding.</p>
                        <p>Their courses include
                            <ul>
                                <li>Responsive Web Design</li>
                                <li>JavaScript Algorithmis and Data Structures</li>
                                <li> Front End Development Libraries</li>
                                <li> Data Visualization</li>
                                <li> Back End Development and APIs </li>
                                <li> Quality Assurance </li>
                                <li>Scientific Computing with Python</li>
                                <li> Information Secuity </li>
                                <li> Machine Learning with Python</li>
                                <li> Coding Interview Prep</li>
                            </ul>
                        </p>
